## 📌 Overview
This project is a fully functional **Sudoku game** built in Python as part of our first milestone at the **Nod Coding Bootcamp**.  

It was an opportunity to combine:
- **Problem-solving**
- **Collaboration**
- **Software development fundamentals**

into one challenging and rewarding task.

Sudoku is a classic logic-based puzzle where players must fill a 9×9 grid so each row, column, and 3×3 subgrid contains digits **1–9** without repetition.  

We implemented:
- **Puzzle creation**
- **User interaction**
- **Game validation**

while ensuring the code was **clean, modular, and easy to maintain**.

## 🎯 Key Project Goals
**Technical Skills**
- Build a complete game using Python functions and logic  
- Apply clean code principles and modular design  
- Implement user-friendly feedback with colors  

**Collaboration Skills**
- First experience working in a **pair programming** setting  
- Collaborated effectively using **GitHub** on the same file without merge conflicts  
- Practiced iterative development and version control best practices  

**Professional Skills**
- Presented the project to peers and instructors  
- Incorporated feedback into improvements  
- Practiced explaining technical concepts clearly to a non-technical audience

## 🛠️ How the Game Works
1. **Board Creation** – Generate both a fully solved puzzle and a playable puzzle with empty spaces.  
2. **Game Display** – Present the puzzle in a clear, structured format.  
3. **Player Input** – Accept row, column, and number from the player.  
4. **Validation** – Check:
   - If the position is empty  
   - If the number follows Sudoku rules  
5. **Game Loop** – Continue until the board is complete or the player chooses to exit.  
6. **Result** – Compare the player’s solution to the original solved puzzle and display a win/lose message.

## 🧠 Challenges & Learnings
- **Version Control in Teams** – Learned to resolve merge conflicts and work on a shared file in real time.  
- **Debugging Complex Logic** – Identified and fixed logic errors through step-by-step validation.  
- **State Management** – Maintained puzzle state to prevent unintended changes to original data.  
- **User Experience** – Enhanced readability with color-coded feedback.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Additional puzzle variations  
- Improved visual design (color-coded player moves, enhanced grid styling)  
- Restrict changes to fixed puzzle numbers  
- Potential **GUI version** using Tkinter or a **web app** version with Streamlit

## 💼 Skills Demonstrated
- **Python Programming** – Functions, loops, conditional logic, data structures  
- **Problem-Solving** – Algorithm design for puzzle generation and validation  
- **Collaboration** – Pair programming and GitHub workflow  
- **Communication** – Technical presentation to peers  
- **Adaptability** – Iterative improvements based on feedback
